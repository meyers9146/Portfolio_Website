                The unoffical blog page of this even more unofficial(less official?)
                website. Welcome! I hope I actually maintain this one.

                Anyway, the goal here is to A) learn and practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                as well as develop a space to showcase projects. I'm not planning on linking
                anything professional here. At least not yet. I'll probably have to make a
                "professional" GitHub page if I ever hope to get employed. For now this just
                feels like one big sandbox for me. Something, something, coarse, rough, irritating, 
                and gets everywhere.
            </p>

                So do people actually write their websites in HTML these days?
                I feel like most of this is autogenerated at this point. Bootstraps, and all that.
